The app combines user-generated reviews, recommendations, and social media-style interactions, making it easier for students to find places to study, eat, or hang out. Users can post hidden gems, leave comments, give ratings, and save favorite spots for later. The process began with brainstorming features and laying out key screens like the home feed and user profile. I selected a color palette that felt friendly and vibrant, reflecting student life. After researching local places and sketching ideas, I created an initial prototype. Based on user feedback, I revised the design and developed a more refined version that focused on improving navigation, visual hierarchy, and engagement features.',
